How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Only potential places where the typo might be were shown.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I could see the progress I made and could gather further knowledge by reflecting on it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: I wont forget to save my progress and if anything goes wrong with my computer the work is safe
    Cons: I might want to reconsider the current change I make before saving it .

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because in a version control all the files belong together and linked to eeach other while a google doc is usually meaningful on its own

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   With git log I can veiw the list of commits, with git diff I can see the actual changes made in that commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I have a safety net to fall back on so I can experiment.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    This bloody course mate
